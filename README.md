A few of the salient features are:

* Phenoview allows a user to simultaneously view data from multiple centres
  for multiple [parameters](https://www.mousephenotype.org/impress).
* It is a web-based tool which is accessible from anywhere around the world
  using a modern internet web browser.
* It provides facilities to download the raw data, for further analysis.
* Visualisations can be bookmarked and shared.

The following are example visualisations:

* [The home page (no gene/parameter selected)](https://beta.mousephenotype.org/phenoview/)

* [Example with gene/parameter selected](https://beta.mousephenotype.org/phenoview/?gid=377,86,1259,1058,171,1152,151,220&qeid=IMPC_GRS_003_001,IMPC_GRS_002_001,IMPC_CSD_031_001&ctrl=1030625)
